I am a Ph.D. student and Graduate Research Assistant at the Washington State University [Embedded and Pervasive Systems Laboratory (EPSL)](http://epsl.eecs.wsu.edu/) under supervision of [Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~hassan/). I am interested in the real-world challenges of working with machine learning models, such as model efficiency and learning ability. Specifically, I am focusing on Model Optimization (e.g., model compression) and Continual (Lifelong) Learning, and my goal is to build efficient learning algorithms that help machines learn the same as humans.

Before joining EPSL, I was an ML Engineer at [Sokhan AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fanavaran-etelaate-sokhan/), where we provided accurate and scalable Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) services to businesses.
